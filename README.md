# tchat

A CLI to create, join and stream chat rooms with Terminal across the world. Join and chat with people you know, and do in the most geeky way possible.

## General

The project is open-source and as such I welcome developers that believe in the idea and would like to commit to the project. For now I didn't set any contribution guidelines as the project is in its infancy, we still have many decisions to make.

Please feel free to discuss with me (and the others that will join us) on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/JNaBJS).
